We still have to go to school. We will still have bills to pay on saturday and/or sunday. Life will continue and is continuing despite the fact that you\'re feeling human. So make you\'re emotions better please. Give today a new meaning; You\'re own meaning. My meaning for today is that ""Today is about love not being in love. Love is abstract. Love is an emotion that our brain can\'t fully comprehend enough to give a definitive definition of. With that in mind, let\'s make today about real love. The love we share with our families. The love we share with our friends. The love we share with the world. Lets make Valentine\'s day about what love really is and not confine it to one type of love."" We\'re barely in February and 2020 might seem really bad right now, but we have to stop paying attention to our perception of what\'s going on around us and start looking at how its really affecting us. 2020 has the opportunity to be amazing and it will be if we want it to. If we all try and make our own individual lives a little bit better each day, all that little change will add up. If this helped you, I\'m very happy and genuinely glad to be of service. If it didn\'t, then I\'m glad that it didn\'t need to. I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your Valentine\'s day, whether it has been going great or has been ""just too much to handle."" If you feel the need to like and share this then please do so. If you don\'t then it\'s okay. I will survive and you will survive and that\'s all I really care about. Goodbye everyone.

Modly in a statement. “Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. observed, ‘Everybody can be great - because anybody can serve’.

Miller, then 22, was collecting laundry when the attack alarm sounded. His normal battle station in an antiaircraft battery magazine was destroyed by a torpedo.

Window-dressing scheme driven by Tokyo-listed Net One Systems\nEIKI HAYASHI, Nikkei staff writer on JANUARY 25, 2020.TOKYO -- A series of fictitious transactions worth more than 40 billion yen ($365 million) that inflated sales at a Toshiba subsidiary was led by a system developer listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s first section, it was learned Friday.The scheme, which began as recently as 2015, involved bogus purchases of equipment from Net One Systems by companies including Toshiba IT-Services, which were supposed to deliver the products via Nippon Steel unit NS Solutions to public-sector customers, sources familiar with the situation said.But no evidence shows any products having actually shipped, suggesting that the arrangement was a case of ""round-tripping"" -- a circular series of sales meant to inflate paper earnings.Toshiba IT-Services booked 20 billion yen in sales from the transactions in question for the six months through September 2019. Toshiba said last week it would remove those sales from its third-quarter earnings. The arrangement also included Fuji Electric subsidiary Fuji Electric IT Solutions and Mizuho-Toshiba Leasing, as well as multiple unlisted tech companies.On paper, Net One would ship the gear directly to NS Solutions, with Toshiba IT-Services and other participants acting as middlemen. Net One ultimately bought the products back from NS Solutions to close the monetary loop.Questionable transactions such as round-tripping can be particularly difficult to spot in the tech industry, where even legitimate deals often involve no physical goods changing hands. Japan has seen several such cases, including the 2008 bankruptcy of information systems company NIWS after it booked roughly 68 billion yen in falsified sales over five years.'}, {'author': 'entelagoodman', 'comment': '☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺'}]"
